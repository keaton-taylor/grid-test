Thanks for looking over this. I included normalize and added in the breakpoint mixin I like. All of this can be found also at https://codepen.io/keaton_taylor/pen/PVgbLB?editors=1100

Thank you again for the chance to speak with you and present my ideas and work to you. I'm so honored and humbled by the opportunity.
